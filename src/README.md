# Intro

The Machine Shell Book __"documentation"__ is meant to be used to capture SandboxCSP solutions. The idea is to offer tools that we use to best serve our Customers.
This MSB changes all the time, as our engineers find better solutions or they may re-write some existing solutions. Happy reading and if you see something that doesn't quite look right then please share it with our distro at __admin@sandboxcsp.com__

__Progress__

<!-- ### What are we creating?
This shell script can be used to install machine level dependencies for say a web server runnign on fedora server. We know certain dependencies must be installed in order for the applications we end up installing on teh server. Let's automate this with and easy to use shell script.  -->
