### What are we creating?
This shell script can be used to install machine level dependencies for say a web server runnign on fedora server. We know certain dependencies must be installed in order for the applications we end up installing on teh server. Let's automate this with and easy to use shell script. 

### Application of this script
- Create a usable nginx web server
- Create a usable docker environment
- Deploy a web application using docker or not!

Reminder - This script is optimized for Fedora Server only, for now :).
